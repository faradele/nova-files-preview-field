### Nova Image Preview Field

This simple package adds a field to nova for showing a collection of uploaded images both on the index (table view) and show pages.

On the index page, the images are represented with tiny thumbnails that can be clicked to open a lightbox while the same behaviour applies on the show page except the thumbnails are bigger.

### NOTE
This is untested and probably not worth using in any serious project. This was made to scratch a very specific itch.
